<p>Awesome! <img src="./Adding multiple enemies to allEnemies array - FEND Project_ Classic Arcade Game Clone - Discourse_files/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<hr>

<p>Note typing <code>Enemy</code> with a capital letter <code>E</code> in the console, will give you the Enemy constructor definition. To inspect the enemy objects, you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter <code>allEnemies</code> and hit return. =&gt; allEnemies Array</li>
<li>Enter <code>allEnemies[0]</code> and hit return. =&gt; first item of the allEnemies Array</li>
<li>Enter <code>table(allEnemies)</code> and hit return. =&gt; allEnemies Array's items as tabular data</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><em>inspect the allEnemies Array in the developer console (screenshot)</em></p>

<p>How does the data look like? Do the enemy instances have all the values they need to be visible on the canvas?</p>

<p>Thank's for the link! It looks like you want to update the remote repository with the local changes.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is what you can do so that we can proceed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Synchronize the remote repository with the local repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Post app.js and engine.js here.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note consider using, for example, the details tag:</p>

<pre><code>[details=app.js]

  // Your script here

[/details]</code></pre>

<p>This will have the following effect:</p>

<details><summary>app.js</summary>

<pre><code>// Your script here</code></pre>
