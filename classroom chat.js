Does anyone know if we have to use the code that was provided as the start? Or are we free to use our own creation with the provided image assets. In addition, since it seems the focus is on OOP are we allowed to use ES6 with a transpiler?

For help with the blank page, you might look at Dev Tools to point you in the right direction.

I do. I'm having some issues to where I've got gems in but they have a tendency to sit on top of each other. I tried making a larger array and then pulling the gems from it, but every time I tried to fix something, something else broke. Here's a gist of the code that doesn't work https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8bc56d212c6e5cf98fb378ba250cbf9f

https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bcba923f33532242d25fd3e1b6cc672a this works but the gems sit on top of each other sometimes

half tempted to just rip out the code stuff for the gems and submit the rest of it just to have it evaluated

Hi all! I turned in my project and it passed! The reviewer gave me some great links to some things but I really wanted to share this one since it's about object-oriented programming in JS which might help others http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/oopjs.shtml

If anyone gets a chance to test my arcade game i'd appreciate it! Score 10 to win, timer ends the game at 3 minutes, faster bugs spawn at 3 and 7 points :) https://felgamedev.github.io/arcadegame/

Scott! Nice job! well done! this project is causing much heartache! LOL I have created all of my assets, but am getting stuck on the game engine; I want to create everything from scratch. I wish I could show you my sprites and "enemies" but here is my game board: https://aliashleyg.github.io/arcade-game/ Lots to do as I learn HTML canvas. :)

Hey Allison, creating a game from scratch is a bit of a learning curve but I would download the files for this project and dissect how they have done it for this assignment. I had to include an extra couple of function calls in the engine.js file myself to handle rendering the GUI I made above the game. I've tried programming games in the past and once you understand the core game loop it all starts to fall into place :)

Hey! Did you guys have to edit the sprites to get rid of the extra padding? it kinda messes the collision detection up...

I just factored it in to my render method and the collision detection

Hi. I am just starting with the game. I already fix the errors from the console and can see the board. But I don't understand what to do next. There is this sentence in description: "Setting the Enemy initial location". How to do it? Where I can find some advice?

Hey, me too I am just starting

If you check in the forum there is a video how to start working on this... On the other hand, is it necessary to do the Canvas course?

Hey Antal, if you open the index.html file you can get some clue from what to do in the error messages (in the browser console)


Hi guys! Could someone give me a hint about the event listener and the player handleInput() function? I literally have no idea how to start to implement that function...

All you need to do is change the x & y values on the player object via the handleInput method, a switch statement works well here (edited)

And of course your Player class needs the render method too
